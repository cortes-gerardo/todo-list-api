## Setting Up
### Prerequisites
- Java 14
- Spring Boot 2.2.7
- Maven 3.6.1
### Local Development
One of the benefits of Sprint Boot is that it comes with an embedded web server. 
Using the Maven build provided by the Spring Boot Initialzr, you'll get a .jar file inside the `/target` directory. 
You can use the `.jar` file to run the entire Spring application.
``` sh
# generates categorizer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
mvn clean install

# runs the application using the embedded web server.
java -jar target/todo-list-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Run Tests
For running the tests you can type 
``` sh
mvn test
```
